</pre><p><a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is an open source small fast run-time text to speech engine. It is the latest addition to the suite of free software synthesis tools including University of Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis System and Carnegie Mellon University's FestVox project, tools, scripts and documentation for building synthetic voices. However, flite itself does not require either of these systems to compile and run.</p>
<p>The core <a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> library was developed by Alan W Black <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'awb'+'@c'+'s.c'+'mu'+'.ed'+'u'; return false;">awb@c<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>s.cm<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>u.edu</a> (mostly in his so-called spare time) while employed in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The name "flite", originally chosen to mean "festival-lite" is perhaps doubly appropriate as a substantial part of design and coding was done over 30,000ft while awb was travelling, and (usually) isn't in meetings.</p>
<p>The voices, lexicon and language components of flite, both their compression techniques and their actual contents were developed by Kevin A. Lenzo <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'len'+'zo'+'@cs'+'.c'+'mu.'+'ed'+'u'; return false;">lenzo<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>@cs.<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>cmu.e<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>du</a> and Alan W Black <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'awb'+'@c'+'s.c'+'mu'+'.ed'+'u'; return false;">awb@c<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>s.cm<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>u.edu</a>.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is the answer to the complaint that Festival is too big, too slow, and not portable enough.</p>
<p>o <a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is designed for very small devices, such as PDAs, and also for large server machines which need to serve lots of ports.</p>
<p>o <a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is not a replacement for Festival but an alternative run time engine for voices developed in the FestVox framework where size and speed is crucial.</p>
<p>o <a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is all in ANSI C, it contains no C++ or Scheme, thus requires more care in programming, and is harder to customize at run time.</p>
<p>o It is thread safe</p>
<p>o Voices, lexicons and language descriptions can be compiled (mostly automatically for voices and lexicons) into C representations from their FestVox formats</p>
<p>o All voices, lexicons and language model data are const and in the text segment (i.e. they may be put in ROM). As they are linked in at compile time, there is virtually no startup delay.</p>
<p>o Although the synthesized output is not exactly the same as the same voice in Festival they are effectively equivalent. That is, flite doesn't sound better or worse than the equivalent voice in festival, just faster, smaller and scalable.</p>
<p>o For standard diphone voices, maximum run time memory requirements are approximately less than twice the memory requirement for the waveform generated. For 32bit architectures this effectively means under 1M.</p>
<p>o The flite program supports, synthesis of individual strings or files (utterance by utterance) to direct audio devices or to waveform files.</p>
<p>o The flite library offers simple functions suitable for use in specific applications.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is distributed with a single 8K diphone voice (derived from the cmu_us_kal voice), a pruned lexicon (derived from cmulex) and a set of models for US English. Here are comparisons with Festival using basically the same 8KHz diphone voice </p><pre class="fragment">            Flite    Festival
core code    60K      2.6M
USEnglish    100K     ??
lexicon      600K     5M
diphone      1.8M     2.1M
runtime      &lt;1M      16-20M
</pre><p>On a 500Mhz PIII, a timing test of the first two chapters of "Alice in Wonderland" (doc/alice) was done. This produces about 1300 seconds of speech. With flite it takes 19.128 seconds (about 70.6 times faster than real time) with Festival it takes 97 seconds (13.4 times faster than real time). On the ipaq (with the 16KHz diphones) flite synthesizes 9.79 time faster than real time.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Requirements:</h2>
<pre class="fragment">o A good C compiler, some of these files are quite large and some C
  compilers might choke on these, gcc is fine.  Sun CC 3.01 has been
  tested too.  Visual C++ 6.0 is known to fail on the large diphone
  database files.  We recommend you use GCC Windows Subsystem for Linux
  Cygwin or mingw32 instead.

o GNU Make

o An audio device isn't required as flite can write its output to 
  a waveform file. 
</pre> <h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Supported platforms:</h2>
<p>We have successfully compiled and run on </p><pre class="fragment">o Various Intel Linux systems (and iPaq Linux), under various versions
  of GCC (2.7.2 to 6.x)

o Mac OS X

o Various Android devices

o Various openwrt devices

o FreeBSD 3.x and 4.x

o Solaris 5.7, and Solaris 9

o Windows 2000/XP and later under Cygwin 1.3.5 and later

o Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux

o Successfully compiles and runs under 64Bit Linux architectures

o OSF1 V4.0 (gives an unimportant warning about sizes when compiled cst_val.c)

o WASI has experimental support (see below for details)
</pre><p> Previously we supported PalmOS and Windows CE but these seem to be rare nowadays so they are no longer actively supported.</p>
<p>Other similar platforms should just work, we have also cross compiled on a Linux machine for StrongARM. However note that new byte order architectures may not work directly as there is some careful byte order constraints in some structures. These are portable but may require reordering of some fields, contact us if you are moving to a new architecture.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Cross-compiling to WASI (experimental)</h3>
<p>In order to successfully cross-compile to WASI, firstly head over to <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sdk">CraneStation/wasi-sdk</a> and install the WASI toolchain.</p>
<p>Afterwards, you can cross-compile to WASI as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">./configure --host=wasm32-wasi \</div>
<div class="line">CC=/path/to/wasi-sdk/bin/clang \</div>
<div class="line">AR=/path/to/wasi-sdk/bin/llvm-ar \</div>
<div class="line">RANLIB=/path/to/wasi-sdk/bin/llvm-ranlib</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>It is important to correctly specify <code>ar</code> and <code>ranlib</code> that is bundled with the WASI <code>clang</code>. Otherwise, you will most likely experience missing symbols during linking, plus you may experience weird <code>llvm</code> errors such as</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">LLVM ERROR: malformed uleb128, extends past end</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>When cross-compiling from macOS, you might have to manually specify the sysroot. You can do this by tweaking the <code>CC</code> variable as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">CC=&quot;/path/to/wasi-sdk/bin/clang --sysroot=/path/to/wasi-sdk/share/sysroot&quot;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>After the configure step is successful, simply run as usual: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The generated WASI binary can then be found in <code>bin/</code> directory:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">file bin/flite</div>
<div class="line">&gt; bin/flite: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)</div>

Compilation</h2>
<p>In general </p><pre class="fragment">tar zxvf flite-2.1-current.tar.gz

cd flite-2.1-current
./configure 
make
make get_voices
</pre><p> Where tar is gnu tar (gtar), and make is gnu make (gmake).</p>
<p>Or </p><pre class="fragment">git clone http://github.com/festvox/flite
cd flite
./configure
make
make get_voices
</pre><p> Configuration should be automatic, but maybe doesn't work in all cases especially if you have some new compiler. You can explicitly set the compiler in config/config and add any options you see fit. Configure tries to guess these but it might be unable to guess for cross compilation cases Interesting options there are </p><pre class="fragment">-DWORDS_BIGENDIAN=1  for bigendian machines (e.g. Sparc, M68x, ar9331)
-DNO_UNION_INITIALIZATION=1  For compilers without C 99 union inintialization
-DCST_AUDIO_NONE     if you don't need/want audio support
</pre><p> There are different sets of voices and languages you can select between them (and your own sets if you make config/XXX.lv). For example </p><pre class="fragment">./configure --with-langvox=transtac
</pre><p> Will use the languages and voices defined in config/transtac.lv</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Usage:</h2>
<p>The ./bin/flite binary contains all supported voices and you may choose between the voices with the -voice flag and list the supported voices with the -lv flag. Note the kal (diphone) voice is a different technology from the others and is much less computationally expensive but more robotic. For each voice additional binaries that contain only that voice are created in ./bin/flite_FULLVOICENAME, e.g. ./bin/flite_cmu_us_awb. You can also refer to external clustergen .flitevox voice via a pathname argument with -voice (note the pathname must contain at least one "/")</p>
<p>If it compiles properly a binary will be put in bin/, note by default -g is on so it will be bigger than is actually required </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite "Flite is a small fast run-time synthesis engine" flite.wav
</pre><p> Will produce an 8KHz riff headered waveform file (riff is Microsoft's wave format often called .WAV). </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite doc/alice
</pre><p> Will play the text file doc/alice. If the first argument contains a space it is treated as text otherwise it is treated as a filename. If a second argument is given a waveform file is written to it, if no argument is given or "play" is given it will attempt to write directly to the audio device (if supported). if "none" is given the audio is simply thrown away (used for benchmarking). Explicit options are also available. </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite -v doc/alice none
</pre><p> Will synthesize the file without playing the audio and give a summary of the speed. </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite doc/alice alice.wav
</pre><p> will synthesize the whole of alice into a single file (previoous versions would only give the last utterance in the file, but that is fixed now).</p>
<p>An additional set of feature setting options are available, these are <em>debug</em> options, Voices are represented as sets of feature values (see lang/cmu_us_kal/cmu_us_kal.c) and you can override values on the command line. This can stop flite from working if malicious values are set and therefor this facility is not intended to be made available for standard users. But these are useful for debugging. Some typical examples are</p>
<p>Use simple concatenation of diphones without prosodic modification </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite --sets join_type=simple_join doc/intro
</pre><p> Print sentences as they are said </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite -pw doc/alice
</pre><p> Make it speak slower </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite --setf duration_stretch=1.5 doc/alice
</pre><p> Make it speak higher pitch </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite --setf int_f0_target_mean=145 doc/alice
</pre><p> The talking clock is an example talking clode as discussed on <a href="http://festvox.org/ldom">http://festvox.org/ldom</a> it requires a single argument HH:MM under Unix you can call it </p><pre class="fragment">./bin/flite_time `date +%H:%M`

Voice quality</h2>
<p>So you've eagerly downloaded flite, compiled it and run it, now you are disappointed that it doesn't sound wonderful, sure its fast and small but what you really hoped for was the dulcit tones of a deep baritone voice that would make you desperately hang on every phrase it mellifluously produces. But instead you get an 8Khz diphone voice that sounds like it came from the last millenium.</p>
<p>Well, first, you are right, it is an 8KHz diphone voice from the last millenium, and that was actually deliberate. As we developed flite we wanted a voice that was stable and that we could directly compare with that very same voice in Festival. <a class="el" href="class_flite.html" title="Arduino API for Flite Text to Speach Engine.">Flite</a> is an <em>engine</em>. We want to be able take voices built with the FestVox process and compile them for flite, the result should be exactly the same quality (though of course trading the size for quality in flite is also an option). The included voice is just a sample voice that was used in the testing process. <br  />
</p>
<p>We expect that often voices will be loaded from external files, and we have now set up a voice repository in </p><pre class="fragment">http://festvox.org/flite/flite-2.1/voices/*.flitevox
</pre><p> If you visit there with a browser you can hear the examples. You can also download the .flitevox files to you machine so you don't need a network connect everytime you need to load a voice.</p>
<p>We are now actively adding to this list of available voices in English (16) and other languages.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Bard Storyteller:  https://github.com/festvox/bard</h2>
<p>Bard is a companion app that reads ebooks, both displaying them and actually reading them to you out loud using flite. Bard supports a wide range of fonts, and flite voices, and books in text, html and epub format. Bard is used as a evaluation of flite's capabilities and an example of a serious application using flite. </p>
